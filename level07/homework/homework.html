        <h1>The First Computer</h1>
        <p><b>The first computer</b> was created in 1943. It was called the <b>ENIAC.</b>
            A group of engineers in the <b><u>United States</u></b> built it during <b>World War II.</b>
            <br>The computer was very big, as big as a room, and it used <b><i>thousands</i></b> of switches and wires. 
            It was made to help with calculations for the army. 
            The <b>ENIAC</b> could do math much <b><u>faster</u></b> than people.</p>

        <h2>ENIAC</h2>
        <p>The <b>ENIAC</b> was very different from today's computers. It did not have a screen, keyboard, or mouse. People had to use many switches and buttons to make it work.
            <br>The computer could only do one task at a time, and it used a lot of <b><u>electricity.</u></b> Even though it was not as smart as modern computers, the <button>ENIAC</button> was a big step forward.
            <br>It showed that machines could solve problems <b>faster</b> than people. This was the beginning of the <b>computer age.</b></p>

        <h2>A Giant Leap into the Computer Age</h2>
        <p><b>The ENIAC</b> was like a giant brain for solving math problems. It took up an entire room and weighed 30 tons. 
            Although slow by today's standards, it could perform calculations much faster than any <button>human.</button>
            <br><b>The ENIAC</b> marked the beginning of the computer age, showing the potential of technology to transform the <b>future.</b></p>
